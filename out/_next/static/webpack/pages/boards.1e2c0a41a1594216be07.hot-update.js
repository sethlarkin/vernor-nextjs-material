The displacement hull belly transitions to a double concave and a V panel behind the rear fin. The narrower tail and outline is the next step in my refinement of high performance Simmons inspired hulls.\\\",\\\"dims\\\":{\\\"range\\\":\\\"5'2\\\\\\\" - 6'4\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Nose\\\":\\\"16 7/8\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Middle\\\":\\\"21\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Tail\\\":\\\"15 7/8\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Thickness\\\":\\\"2 1/2\\\",\\\"Volume\\\":\\\"35.65 liters (101 Dr Peppers)\\\"},\\\"video\\\":\\\"NJqDCzULoZg\\\",\\\"eps_price\\\":\\\"799.00\\\",\\\"poly_price\\\":\\\"699.00\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":25,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Rocco\\\",\\\"model\\\":\\\"rocco\\\",\\\"img\\\":\\\"/img/boards/main-rocco.jpg\\\",\\\"logo\\\":\\\"/img/board-models/rocco.png\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Very low entry rocker and extended tail kick for tight rail turns.

Just like the Mini Simmons and the Silver Bullet II, the DBS has a displacement hull in the front with a double concave toward the tail. This allows the board to glide across flat sections while still being able to go vertical. Adaptable in conditions from one foot up to a few feet overhead. This particular board is my favorite for traveling because it’s so versatile. The 5 fin boxes setup allows the rider to play with different fin setups. I prefer to use the Future Fins T1 setup. This board is a must for any quiver.\\\",\\\"dims\\\":{\\\"range\\\":\\\"5'2\\\\\\\" - 6'4\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Nose\\\":\\\"15 7/16\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Middle\\\":\\\"21\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Tail\\\":\\\"17 5/8\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Thickness\\\":\\\"2 11/16\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Volume\\\":\\\"36 liters\\\"},\\\"video\\\":\\\"Tzeur8nH-y8\\\",\\\"eps_price\\\":\\\"799.00\\\",\\\"poly_price\\\":\\\"699.00\\\"}]}\");//# sourceURL=[module]\n//# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;charset=utf-8;base64,eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjozLCJzb3VyY2VzIjpbXSwibmFtZXMiOltdLCJtYXBwaW5ncyI6IiIsImZpbGUiOiIuL2xpYi9ib2FyZHMuanNvbi5qcyIsInNvdXJjZVJvb3QiOiIifQ==\n//# sourceURL=webpack-internal:///./lib/boards.json\n");
