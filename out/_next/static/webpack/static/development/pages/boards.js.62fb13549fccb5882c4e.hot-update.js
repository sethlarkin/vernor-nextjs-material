The shape of the board lends itself to high performance surfing, with a nod to the retro inspired hipsters. We suggest riding the board between 6’6 and 8’0 and in a variety of conditions (between 2’ and 8’).\",\"dims\":{\"range\":\"6'6\\\" - 8'0\",\"Nose\":\"16 1/8\",\"Middle\":\"21 5/8\",\"Tail\":\"15 3/8\",\"Thickness\":\"3\\\"\",\"Volume\":\"(7'0\\\"): 46.5 liters (131 beers)\"}},{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"Chef\",\"img\":\"/img/boards/main-chef.jpg\",\"logo\":\"/img/board-models/ChefLogo.jpg\",\"description\":\"The chef is a tweaked version of the rubble that David and I worked on together. We wanted to create a board that would enhance my aerial surfing yet have a curvy outline to surf in the pocket. By adding more width in the nose and tail, the board feels like a skateboard, single concave, ultra-fast and loose! If you want to push your surfing to the next level, this is the board for you! - Noah Threlked\",\"dims\":{\"range\":\"Size range: 5'2\\\" - 6'4\\\"\",\"Nose\":\"13 5/8\\\"\",\"Middle\":\"20 5/8\\\"\",\"Tail\":\"16\\\"\",\"Thickness\":\"2 5/8\\\"\",\"Volume\":\"(5'11\\\"): 33 liters (92.98 beers)\"}},{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"The Hunter\",\"img\":\"/img/boards/main-hunter.jpg\",\"logo\":\"/img/board-models/HunterLogo.jpg\",\"description\":\"The Hunter is our newest, larger-volume, foam-forward, single concave step up model. The nose template allows you to ride it 4-6 inches shorter than the Scorpion in the same conditions. You have the shortest board built for performance and control on the biggest waves.\",\"dims\":{\"range\":\"Size range: \\\"5'8\\\" - 7'2\\\"\",\"Nose\":\"13 5/8\\\"\",\"Middle\":\"20\\\"\",\"Tail\":\"14 1/4\\\"\",\"Thickness\":\"2 1/4\\\"\",\"Volume\":\"(5'10\\\"): 38 liters (107 beers)\"}},{\"id\":4,\"name\":\"Barracuda\",\"img\":\"/img/boards/main-barracuda.jpg\",\"logo\":\"/img/board-models/BarracudaLogo.png\",\"description\":\"The Barracuda is our version of a high-performance four fin fish, with more short board feeling rails and a thinned out tail! This board glides like a fish and explodes and reacts like your normal short board. The quad-fin set up holds a higher line in the more critical part of the wave. The Barracuda gives you the best of both worlds. - David Vernor\",\"dims\":{\"range\":\"5' - 6'4\\\"\",\"Nose\":\"16 5/8\\\"\",\"Middle\":\"21 1/4\\\"\",\"Tail\":\"15 7/8\\\"\",\"Thickness\":\"2 5/8\\\"\",\"Volume\":\"(6'0\\\"): 32.8 liters (92 Dr Peppers)\"}},{\"id\":5,\"name\":\"Mini Simmons\",\"img\":\"/img/boards/main-mini-simmons.jpg\",\"logo\":\"/img/board-models/MiniSimmonsLogo.jpg\",\"description\":\"Old and new ideas come together, this displacement hull and almost no rocker has been improved by ending the tail with a double con cave and a 4-fin setup. the fastest board I've ever ridden. - David Vernor\",\"dims\":{\"range\":\"5' - 6'4\\\"\",\"Nose\":\"18 1/8\\\"\",\"Middle\":\"22\\\"\",\"Tail\":\"17 3/4\\\"\",\"Thickness\":\"2 3/4\\\"\",\"Volume\":\"(5'10\\\"): 41.3 liters (116 Dr Peppers)\"}},{\"id\":6,\"name\":\"The Falcon\",\"img\":\"/img/boards/main-falcon.jpg\",\"logo\":\"/img/board-models/FalconLogo.jpg\",\"description\":\"The Falcon is the most versatile board in my quiver. This board goes to the beach with me whether it's waist high or overhead. It's a versatile, responsive, high performance machine. It makes waist-high groveling days fun and works in pumping barrels. I've tested this board in the beach breaks of Bethany beach Delaware, Cape Hatteras, and the reef breaks of Puerto Rico. Order yours today! - Colin Herlihy\",\"dims\":{\"range\":\"5'2\\\" - 6'6\\\"\",\"Nose\":\"15 7/8\\\"\",\"Middle\":\"19 7/8\\\"\",\"Tail\":\"15 7/8\",\"Thickness\":\"2 5/8\",\"Volume\":\"(5'8\\\"): 32 liters (90 beers)\"}},{\"id\":7,\"name\":\"Hellbilly\",\"img\":\"/img/boards/main-hellbilly.jpg\",\"logo\":\"/img/board-models/HellbillyLogo.jpg\",\"description\":\"The story: I reached out to David telling him I needed a board that was specifically for low tide shorebreak. Something that paddled fast and was responsive enough for under the lip take offs, loose and manueverable to pump through barrels. My 5'10 is 3 inches thick. I asked for extra float to paddle fast and float me in a 5mm suit. I also asked for this board to have David's special epoxy application with a round pin and 5 fin set up. The name the Hellbilly came from my love for the outdoors and outlaw country music. - Colin\",\"dims\":{\"range\":\"4'8\\\" - 6'4\\\"\",\"Nose\":\"15 7/8\\\"\",\"Middle\":\"20 7/8\\\"\",\"Tail\":\"15 7/8\",\"Thickness\":\"2 7/8\",\"Volume\":\"(6'0\\\"): 38 liters (107 Dr Peppers)\"}},{\"id\":8,\"name\":\"Baker\",\"img\":\"/img/boards/main-baker.jpg\",\"logo\":\"/img/board-models/VernorLogo.jpg\",\"description\":\"The Baker is our newest idea in high-performance twin-fins that can also be ridden as a thruster. The Baker is super-fast and loose with a single or double-concave, accelerated-V out the tail, and a big nose so we can push more volume forward. This allows for super-easy wave catching. I recommend getting this board 2 inches smaller than your Chef.\",\"dims\":{\"range\":\"4'8\\\" - 6'4\\\"\",\"Nose\":\"13 7/8\\\"\",\"Middle\":\"19 1/4\\\"\",\"Tail\":\"15 1/2\",\"Thickness\":\"2 5/8\",\"Volume\":\"(5'10\\\"): 31.5 liters (89 Dr Peppers)\"}},{\"id\":9,\"name\":\"Donkey Jumper II\",\"img\":\"/img/boards/main-donkey-ii.jpg\",\"logo\":\"/img/board-models/VernorLogo.jpg\",\"description\":\"Short, wide and ugly, but fun and fast.

And here’s the Tech story for you. This is an I-foam blank from Marko foam with a bamboo stringer, its laminated with1 layer of s-glass on both sides, suspension on the inside and vector-net with carbon pro-toes on the deck. This is my favorite go-to board that snaps off the bottom and top better than anything I have ever ridden. The recoil and spring are unbelievable with these materials you won’t be disappointed!\",\"dims\":{\"range\":\"5'2\\\" - 6'10\\\"\",\"Nose\":\"12 7/8\\\"\",\"Middle\":\"20 5/8\\\"\",\"Tail\":\"15 7/8\",\"Thickness\":\"2 5/8\",\"Volume\":\"(6'0\\\"): 34. liters (93 Dr Peppers)\"}}]}");
